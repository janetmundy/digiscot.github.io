## Project plan

### Project description

Move On will provide IT Literacy skills to service users in Glasgow who have experienced homelessness or the care system.  This will be delivered by literacy tutors through one-to-one and group sessions on common IT tasks including internet/e-mail, intro to word processing and spreadsheets.  Service users will be identified through personal plans drawn up at the beginning of their engagement with our existing literacy programme.

The project will also include setting up and moderating a secure online group for current and past service users to practise their skills and to facilitate monitoring their ongoing use of IT and the overall impact their increased skills and knowledge has on their lives.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1

we are currently working on updating our website, which will include more detailed information about our IT literacy support. We will also produce fliers shortly.

Our literacy tutors have benchmarked the skills of 9 learners so far this year.  We record progress formally every 6-8 weeks, but there are already exciting developments:

We took a group of learners to the Aye Write Literary Festival in Glasgow in April, to view a display of their creative writing efforts. They used the laptop purchased as part of this project to prepare a presentation on their experience, with photographs and text which they composed themselves.

Over the next few weeks our learners will be working on composing and typing up stories on "Journeys" to upload to the [Scottish Book Trust website](http://scottishbooktrust.com/writing/journeys). 


### Phase 2

- Set up secure online group
- Monitor skills development
- Midway review

### Phase 3

- Service users regularly communicate via online group
